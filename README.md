```

## API Endpoints
| HTTP Verbs | Endpoints | Action | Permission
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | /auth | To generate authentication token. | Public
| GET | /urgency | To locate the nearest hospital taking care of the pathology. | Restricted to authenticated users

## How to use the application ?
### Authenticate
To be able to use the application you need to authenticate yourself first.
In order to do so open postman, use the POST endpoint `http://localhost:8089/auth` with the following body request :
```
{
    "username": "cl√©ment",
    "password": "password"
}
```
This authentication request, if successful, generates a token returned in the header of the response associated to the key `token`. Save it for later.

### Use the urgency service
Once authenticated you can use the urgency service to get the closest hospital taking care of the provided [pathology](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/course.oc-static.com/projects/Architecte+Logiciel+FR/P11/Donne%CC%81es+de+re%CC%81fe%CC%81rence+sur+les+spe%CC%81cialite%CC%81s+NHS.pdf).
In order to do so open postman, use the GET endpoint with your own parameters :
```
http://localhost:8081/urgency/latitude/longitude/pathology/ambulance_id
```
Finally select `Bearer Token` in the Authorization tab and paste your saved token.
Sending your request will return to you the closest hospital available according to the pathology of your patient.

Hereunder you can find an example of a request for an authenticated user :
```
http://localhost:8081/urgency/51.585049/-0.175270/Allergy/45
```
